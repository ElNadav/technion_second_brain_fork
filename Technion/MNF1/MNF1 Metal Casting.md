# Introduction
Several methods can be used to shape materials into useful products. **Casting** is one of the oldest methods and was first used about 4000 B.C. to make ornaments, arrowheads and various other objects. The important factors in casting operation are:
1. **Solidication** of the metal from its molten state, and accompanying shrinkage.
2. **Flow** of the molten metal into the mold cavity.
3. **Heat transfer** during solidication and cooling of the metal in the mold; and
4. **Mold material** and its influence on the casting operation.


# Cast Structures
The type of **cast structure** developed during solidification of metals and alloys depends on the composition of the particular ally, the rate of heat transfer, and the flow of the liquid metal during the casting process.

## Pure Metals
The typical grain structure of pure metal that has solidified in a sqaure mold is shown in the following figure:

Note in the middle of the figure that only favorable oriented grains grow away the mold surface; $(b)$ solid-solution alloys; and $(c)$ structure obtained by heterogeneous nucleation of grains.

At the mold walls the metal cools rapidly (**chill zone**) because the walls are at ambient or slightly elevated temprature, and as a result, the casting develops a solidified **skin** (shell) of find **equiaxed grains**. The grains grow in the direction opposite to the heat transfer from the mold. Grains that have a favorable orientation, called **columnar grains**, grow preferntially.

## Alloys
Because pure metals have limited mechanical properties, they are often enhanced and modified by **alloying**. The vast majority of metals used in engineering applications are some form of an **alloy**, defined as two or more chemical elements, at least one of which is a metal.

In [[Technion/IMT1/IMT1_004 דיאגרמת פאזות#דיאגרמת פאזות בינארית|Introduction to Material Engineering]] we have seen that solidification in alloys begins when the temprature drops below the **liquidus**, $T_{L}$, and is complete when it reaches the **solidus**, $T_{S}$. Within this temprature range, the alloy is in a mushy or pasty state, with **columnar dendrites**.

Note in the lower right of the figure the presence of liquid metal between the dendrite arms. Dendrites have three-dimensional arms and branches, which eventaully interlock, as shown in the next figure:

It takes about two hours for this casting so solidify completely. $(b)$ Solidification of carbon steels in sand and chill (metal) molds.
