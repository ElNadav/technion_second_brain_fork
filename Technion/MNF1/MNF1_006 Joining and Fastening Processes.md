# Introduction
From [[MNF1_000 034030 Manufacturing Processes#Bibliography|(Kalpakjian & Schmid, 2016)]]:
Joining is a general, all-inclusive term covering numerous processes that are important in manufacturing. Joining may be preferred or necessary for one or more of the following reasons:
- The product is impossible or uneconomical to manufacture as a single piece;
- The product is easier and less costly to manufacture in individual components, which are then assembled;
- The product may have to be taken apart for repair or maintenance during its service life;
- Different properties may be required for function of the product; for example, surfaces that are subjected to friction and wear, or to corrosion and environmental attack, typically require characteristics different than those of the component’s bulk; and 
- Transportation of the product in individual components and their subsequent assembly may be easier and more economical than transporting it as a single unit.

There are many categories of joining and fastening processes; In our course we will focus on **welding** and **brazing and soldering**.

# Fusion Welding

Fusion welding involves melting and coalescing of materials by means of heat, usually supplied by electrical or other means.


## Oxyfuel Gas Welding
Developed in the early 1900s, oxyfuel gas welding (OFW) is a general term describing any welding process that uses a fuel gas, combined with oxygen to produce a flame as the heat source required to melt the metals at the joint.


![[MNF1_006/Pasted image 20240816152658.png|book]]
>The principle of the oxyfuel gas welding operation [[MNF1_000 034030 Manufacturing Processes#Bibliography|(Kalpakjian & Schmid, 2016)]].

The heat generated in OFW is a result of the combustion of acetylene gas ($\ce{ {C}_{2}{H}_{2} }$) in a mixture with oxygen, in accordance with a pair of chemical reactions. The primary combustion, which occurs in the inner core of the flame  involves the reaction
$$\ce{ {C}_{2}H2 + {O}_{2}\to 2CO + {H}_{2} + heat }$$
This reaction dissociates the acetylene into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and produces about one-third of the total heat generated in the flame.

The secondary combustion process is
$$\ce{ 2CO + {H}_{2} + 1.5{O}_{2}\to  2C{O}_{2} + {H}_{2}O + heat }$$
This reaction produces about two-thirds of the total heat; note that the reaction also produces water vapor. The temperatures developed in the flame can reach $3300^{\circ}\pu{C}$.

## Arc Welding Processes: Consumable Electrode
In arc welding, developed in the mid-1800s, the heat required is obtained from electrical energy. Using either a consumable or a nonconsumable rod or wire electrode, an electric arc is produced between the tip of the electrode and the parts to be welded, using an AC or DC power supply.

### Shielded Metal Arc Welding
Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) is one of the oldest, simplest, and most versatile joining processes; currently, about one-half of all industrial and maintenance welding is performed by this process.
The electric arc is generated by touching the tip of a coated electrode to the workpiece, then withdrawing it quickly to a distance sufficient to maintain the arc.

![[MNF1_006/Pasted image 20240816161001.png|book]]
>(a) Schematic illustration of the shielded metal arc welding process; about one-half of all large-scale industrial welding operations use this process. (b) Schematic illustration of the shielded metal arc welding operation [[MNF1_000 034030 Manufacturing Processes#Bibliography|(Kalpakjian & Schmid, 2016)]].

In this operation, the bare section at one end of the electrode is clamped to one terminal of the power source, while the other terminal is connected to the part being welded.

The **polarity** (direction of current flow) of the DC current may be important, depending on such factors as the type of electrode, the metals to be welded, and the depth of the heated zone. When the current is AC, the arc pulsates rapidly, a condition that is suitable for welding thick sections, using larger diameter electrodes and higher electrical current.

### Gas Metal Arc Welding

In gas metal arc welding (GMAW), the weld area is shielded by an external source of gas, such as argon, helium, carbon dioxide, and various gas mixtures.
![[MNF1_006/Pasted image 20240816163841.png|book]]
>Gas metal arc welding process [[MNF1_000 034030 Manufacturing Processes#Bibliography|(Kalpakjian & Schmid, 2016)]].

Developed in the 1950s, the GMAW process is suitable for a variety of ferrous and nonferrous metals. Used extensively in the metal fabrication industry, the operation is rapid, versatile, and economical, and its welding productivity is double that of the SMAW process.

## Arc Welding Processes: Nonconsumable Electrode

Nonconsumable electrode arc welding processes typically use a tungsten electrode. As one pole of the arc, the electrode generates the heat required for welding; a shielding gas is supplied from an external source.

### Gas Tungsten Arc Welding

In gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), formerly called TIG welding (for tungsten inert gas), a filler metal is typically supplied from a filler wire. The composition of filler metals must be similar to that of the metals welded.

Because the tungsten electrode is not consumed in this operation, a constant and stable arc gap is maintained at a constant level of current.

### Plasma Arc Welding
Plasma is ionized hot gas, consisting of nearly equal numbers of electrons and ions. In plasma arc welding (PAW), developed in the 1960s, a concentrated plasma arc is produced and aimed at the weld area. The arc is stable and reaches temperatures as high as $\pu{33000} ^{\circ}\pu{C}$;

Compared with other arc welding processes, plasma arc welding has (a) greater energy concentration, thus deeper and narrower welds can be made; (b) better arc stability; (c) less thermal distortion; and (d) higher welding speeds, such as $120-1000\, \pu{mm/\min_{}}$.

>Two types of plasma arc welding processes: (a) transferred and (b) nontransferred. Deep and narrow welds are made by this process at high welding speeds [[MNF1_000 034030 Manufacturing Processes#Bibliography|(Kalpakjian & Schmid, 2016)]].

# High Energy Beam Welding
Joining with high energy beams, principally laser-beam and electron-beam welding, has important applications in modern manufacturing, because of its high quality and technical and economic advantages.

## Electron-Beam Welding
In electron-beam welding (EBW), heat is generated by high-velocity, narrow-beam electrons; the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into heat as the electrons strike the workpiece.

## Laser-Beam Welding
Laser-beam welding (LBW) uses a high-power laser as the source of heat. Because the laser beam can be highly focused to as small a diameter as $\pu{10\mu m}$, it has high energy density and deep penetrating capability. This process is thus particularly suitable for making deep and narrow joints.

# Oxyfuel–gas Cutting
In addition to being cut by mechanical means, material can be cut into various contours using a heat source that melts and removes a narrow zone in the workpiece. The sources of heat can be torches, electric arcs, or lasers.

Oxyfuel–gas cutting (OFC) is similar to [[#Oxyfuel Gas Welding]], 
but the heat source is used to *remove* a narrow zone from a metal plate or sheet.
# Resistance Welding
Resistance welding (RW) operations include several processes in which the heat required for welding is produced by means of the **electrical resistance** between the two members to be joined.

# Brazing and Soldering
Two joining processes that involve lower temperatures than those required for welding are brazing and soldering; they are arbitrarily distinguished by temperature, although brazing temperatures are higher than those for soldering.

In brazing, a process first used as far back as 3000–2000 B.C, a filler metal is first placed at or between the surfaces to be joined; the temperature is then raised to melt the filler metal, but not the parts.
