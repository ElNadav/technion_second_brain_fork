# Introduction
From [[LSY1_000 034032 Linear Systems E#Bibliography|(Lathi & Green, 2018)]]:
The counterpart of the [[LSY1_007 Laplace Transform#The Laplace Transform|Laplace transform]] for discrete-time systems is the $z$-transform. The Laplace transform converts integro-differential equations into algebraic equations. In the same way, the z-transforms changes difference equations into algebraic equations, thereby simplifying the analysis of discrete-time systems.

The behavior of discrete-time systems is similar to that of continuous-time systems (with some differences). The frequency-domain analysis of discrete-time systems is based on the fact that the response of a linear, time-invariant, discrete-time (LTID) system to an everlasting exponential $z^{n}$ is the same exponential (within a multiplicative constant) given by $H[z]z^{n}$. We then express an input $x[n]$ as a sum of (everlasting) exponentials of the form $z^{n}$.The system response to $x[n]$ is then found as a sum of the system’s responses to all these exponential components. The tool that allows us to represent an arbitrary input $x[n]$ as a sum of (everlasting) exponentials of the form $z^{n}$ is the $z$-transform.
